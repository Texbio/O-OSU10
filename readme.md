`O&OSU10 (O&O ShutUp10++)` is a program used for debloating windows. `O&OSU10.reg` was made from the application [O&O ShutUp10++](https://www.oo-software.com/en/shutup10) on a Windows 10 Pro 2H22 system, using [Procmon](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/procmon) to get registery keys from `O&OSU10` and make `O&OSU10.reg`. 

This reg file contains all settings from `O&OSU10`, and is very easily customizable using any text editor.

`O&OSU10` actually had more than 10 settings that either didn't work or did something completely different from what it said it does, and I had to do some research to find replacement reg keys.
